# Contributing

## Participation Policy
This repository is public for visibility and reference, but participation is invite-only.

Only approved participants may open issues or pull requests:
- repository collaborators, and
- approved automation identities maintained in `.github/approved-actors.yml`.

Fork-based pull requests from non-collaborators are not accepted, even for approved automation identities.

Issues and pull requests opened by unapproved actors are automatically labeled `unapproved`, receive an explanatory comment, and are closed.

## Guidance for Collaborators

### Issues
- Provide clear reproduction steps.
- Include environment details (OS, runtime/container version, relevant configuration).
- Attach logs, traces, or screenshots when relevant.
- State expected behavior and actual behavior.

### Pull Requests
- Keep changes focused and small.
- Include tests for behavior changes.
- Update documentation when behavior or interfaces change.
- Ensure CI and diagnostics relevant to your change pass.

## Security
Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly in issues or pull requests. Report security concerns through private channels.
