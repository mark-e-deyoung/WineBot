## Progress Today
- **System Recovery & Stabilization:**
    - Recovered from OOM crash and addressed root causes.
    - Resolved `wmctrl` segmentation faults by migrating to `xdotool` and `xprop`.
    - Fixed "black screen" input-blocking overlay issue.
    - Implemented background supervisor loops for AHK input tracers to ensure resilience.
- **Policy Enforcement:**
    - Established **Containerized Tooling Policy** (`policy/containerized-tooling-policy.md`).
    - Removed host-level `.venv` and verified all dev/test tasks run in containers.
- **Dashboard UI/UX Quality:**
    - Implemented a new E2E suite (`tests/e2e/test_zz_dashboard_ux_compliance.py`) verifying palette, state transitions, and responsiveness.
    - Fixed mobile drawer backdrop click handling.
    - Standardized project-wide formatting and cleared 60+ linting issues.

## Validation Status
- **Unit Tests:** 11/11 Passed.
- **E2E Tests:** 11/11 Passed (Full suite).
- **Total Stability:** 100% pass rate across 18+ tests.

## Next Steps
1. Integrate Google Lighthouse CI for automated Accessibility scoring.
2. Implement Visual Regression diffing (Tier 3 UX enforcement).
3. Research custom Wine builds for footprint reduction (Issue #5).

## Session Relevant Items
- `wmctrl` is deprecated/forbidden in this project due to instability in Debian Trixie/Wine 10.0.
- All testing must use `docker compose -f compose/docker-compose.yml --profile test ...`.
