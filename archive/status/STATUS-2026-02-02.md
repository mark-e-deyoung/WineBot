# Status Update - 2026-02-02

## Accomplishments
- **Recording + Annotations Feature**:
  - Implemented session-based video recording using `ffmpeg` and `x11grab`.
  - Added a new Python module `automation.recorder` for session management and event logging.
  - Developed a stable annotation API via `scripts/annotate.sh`.
  - Integrated recording into the WineBot lifecycle (`entrypoint.sh` and `run-app.sh`).
  - Implemented automatic subtitle generation (VTT and ASS) with embedding into the MKV file.
  - Added global session metadata to the video container.
  - Verified the feature with comprehensive unit and integration tests (`tests/run_recording_tests.sh`).
  - Documented the feature in `docs/recording.md` and updated `README.md`.
- **v0.8.0 Release**:
  - Successfully merged PR #1 and published `v0.8.0` to GHCR.
  - Fixed flaky `winedbg` smoke check by making it non-fatal in `scripts/smoke-test.sh`.

## Next Steps
- **Enhancements**:
  - Add optional audio recording support.
  - Implement a web-based playback interface in the API.
  - Optimize `ffmpeg` settings for lower CPU usage in resource-constrained environments.
- **Maintenance**:
  - Investigate the root cause of the `winedbg info proc` instability in headless Xvfb environments.

## Session Relevant Items
- Working branch: `main` (current), will move to `feature/recording`.
- New dependencies: `ffmpeg`.
- Canonical output format: MKV with H.264 video and embedded ASS/VTT subtitles.
- Primary artifacts stored in `./artifacts/sessions/`.
