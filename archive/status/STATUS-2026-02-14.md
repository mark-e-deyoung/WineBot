# Status - 2026-02-14

## Progress Today
- **Build Performance:** Removed the resource-intensive Windows Python `pip` bootstrap from the Dockerfile. Saved ~3 minutes per clean build and reduced image complexity.
- **CLI Output & Stability (Issue #2):**
    - Fixed `entrypoint.sh` to correctly launch and capture output from CLI applications in headless mode.
    - Enhanced API and `scripts/run-app.sh` to support `stderr` capture and noise suppression via `--quiet`.
    - Improved path validation to allow execution of "naked" Windows commands (e.g., `cmd.exe`).
    - Made the Desktop Supervisor more robust against crash loops and noise.
- **Network Discovery (Issue #3):**
    - Implemented `DiscoveryManager` in `api/core/discovery.py` using `zeroconf` (mDNS/DNS-SD).
    - Added dynamic TXT records reporting `vnc_url`, `api_port`, `version`, and running `.exe` processes.
    - Implemented Singleton mode (`ALLOW_MULTIPLE_SESSIONS=False`) to prevent concurrent session conflicts.
    - *Status:* Implementation complete; undergoing final verification.
- **Dashboard Enhancements:**
    - Improved noVNC connection reliability with dynamic host/port detection.
    - Implemented auto-save for API Token and VNC Password in `localStorage`.
    - Fixed persistence bugs related to UI layout (collapsible panels).
- **Resource Characterization:** Filed a detailed report in `docs/build-performance-and-resource-utilization.md`.

## Validation Status
- **CLI Mode:** Verified `hostname.exe` and `cmd.exe` output capture via `scripts/run-app.sh --direct-cli`.
- **mDNS:** Verified service advertisement and TXT record accuracy via `tests/test_discovery.py`.
- **Singleton Guard:** Verified container abort behavior when a session conflict is detected.

## Next Steps
1. Finalize verification of Issue #3 (mDNS) in varied network environments (Bridge vs Host mode).
2. Address modular 'Slim' intent (Issue #4) to provide a prefix-less image variant.
3. Research custom Wine builds (Issue #5) for baseline footprint reduction.
