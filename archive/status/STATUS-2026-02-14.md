## Progress Today
- **Dashboard Reliability & Correctness:**
    - **VNC Connectivity:** Fixed a critical bug where the Dashboard was stuck on "connecting..." due to an incorrect WebSocket path and missing handshake timeout. It now correctly uses `/websockify`.
    - **Persistence:** Added missing `localStorage` logic for VNC Host and Port settings.
    - **UI State Machine:** Fixed a JS syntax error (duplicate declaration) that halted dashboard updates.
    - **Lifecycle Badges:** Updated the backend API to return the detailed `processes` structure expected by the UI.
    - **Cache Management:** Added `no-cache` headers to the UI endpoint to ensure users always receive the latest version.
- **End-to-End Testing (Playwright):**
    - Established a new containerized E2E test environment in `tests/e2e/`.
    - Created `test_dashboard_e2e.py` to verify dashboard loading and VNC authentication.
    - Created `test_input_quality.py` to verify 1:1 mouse coordinate mapping through the browser.
- **Maintenance & Stability:**
    - Fixed the entire unit test suite (`tests/test_api.py`, `tests/test_policy.py`, etc.) which had drifted due to refactoring.
    - Updated `docker/Dockerfile` to include policy test dependencies in the `intent-test` stage.
- **Network Discovery (Issue #3):**
    - Created `tests/test_discovery.py` to verify `DiscoveryManager` and singleton logic.
    - Verified mDNS announcements via `tests/diagnose_mdns.py`.

## Validation Status
- **Unit Tests:** 53/53 Passed (inside container).
- **E2E Tests:** Dashboard load and Input quality tests passing in Playwright container.
- **Manual Verification:** VNC standalone (`vnc.html`) and Dashboard UI confirmed reachable and functional.

## Next Steps
1. Finalize `test_comprehensive_input.py` to demonstrate full-stack input accuracy on Windows objects (Notepad).
2. Address modular 'Slim' intent (Issue #4) to provide a prefix-less image variant.
3. Research custom Wine builds (Issue #5) for baseline footprint reduction.
