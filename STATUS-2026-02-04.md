# Session Status - 2026-02-04

## Achievements
- **API Scalability:** Implemented native `/proc` scanning and `asyncio.gather` for process checks, reducing health-check overhead and latency.
- **Resource Management:** Added a global `process_store` and background reaper task to prevent zombie processes.
- **Correctness:** Migrated state management to `RecorderState` Enums and converted blocking subprocess calls to non-blocking `asyncio` commands.
- **Input Fixes:**
    - Identified a regression in `docker/openbox/rc.xml` via bisection against `v0.8.0`.
    - Restored `Client` context mouse bindings to allow click pass-through.
    - Disabled `UseXInput2` in Wine to force compatibility with standard X11 events.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:**
    - Created `scripts/diagnose-input-suite.sh` using Computer Vision (`cv2`) to verify mouse clicks visually.
    - Implemented parallel diagnostics for **AutoHotkey** and **AutoIt** for cross-tool validation.
    - Verified that `xdotool` injection and keyboard automation are fully functional.
- **Dashboard UX:** Added VNC settings (scaling, view-only), coordinate logging, and a real-time **Artifacts Viewer** for easy access to recordings.
- **Safety:** Implemented a **disk space watchdog** that auto-stops recording if free space drops below 300MB.

## Current Blockers
- **Direct VNC Clicks:** Despite fixing the Openbox regression and verifying `xdotool` success, direct mouse clicks via the VNC protocol (noVNC/VNC Viewer) are still failing to reach Wine applications in some environments.

## Session Artifacts
- **Diagnostic Video:** `artifacts/sessions/.../video_006.mkv` (Confirms CV-based Notepad click success).
- **Verbose Logs:** `x11vnc` is now logging to `$SESSION_DIR/logs/x11vnc.log`.

## Next Steps
1. **Analyze x11vnc.log:** Review the verbose VNC output to see if client pointer events are reaching the X server.
2. **Pointer Grab Check:** Investigate if any component is holding an exclusive pointer grab.
3. **Release v0.9.0:** Once direct VNC clicks are confirmed, tag the new release.
