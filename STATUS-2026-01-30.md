# Status 2026-01-30

## Current state
- Local branch: `main` (ahead of `origin/main` by 1 commit).
- Latest release: `v0.5.1` (failed in GitHub Actions release workflow).
- Failure cause: `scripts/smoke-test.sh --full` failed with "File was not created by Notepad" in `automation/notepad_create_and_verify.py`.
- Fix implemented: Notepad automation now pre-creates the output file/dir and launches Notepad with the target file path to avoid Save As dialog flakiness.

## Recent changes
- Commit `d81fe0d`: Harden Notepad automation save flow.

## Validation
- Local smoke test succeeded: `scripts/smoke-test.sh --full --include-debug --include-debug-proxy --cleanup`.

## CI status
- Release workflow for `v0.5.1`: run `21487511266` failed in Notepad automation step.
- Prior release `v0.5`: failed Trivy scan (now addressed by base package upgrade in `64714dc`).

## Next steps
1. Push `main` (includes Notepad automation fix).
2. Tag and create release `v0.5.2` at tip of `main`.
3. Monitor the release workflow; if it fails, pull logs and address root cause.

## Session notes
- Status file created to track the release fix workflow and resume later if needed.
