# Status 2026-01-30

## Current state
- Local branch: `main`.
- Previous Release attempts: `v0.5.1` failed.
- **Current Work:** Major dependency upgrades to modernize the stack.

## Changes Implemented
1.  **Python Upgrade:** `windows-tools/download_tools.sh` updated to use Python `3.12.8` (Embedded) as 3.11 is now security-fix only and binary artifacts are no longer produced.
2.  **OS Upgrade:** `docker/Dockerfile` base image updated from `debian:bookworm-slim` (Debian 12) to `debian:trixie-slim` (Debian 13/Testing).
    *   **Goal:** Access to Wine 10.0+ (via Debian Trixie repos) for better application support.

## Validation
- **Build:** `winebot:latest` built successfully.
- **Manual Smoke Tests:**
    *   `tests/run_smoke_tests.sh` (AutoIt, AHK) -> **PASSED**.
    *   `automation/notepad_create_and_verify.py` -> **PASSED** (Notepad launched, text entered, file saved).
- **Environment Note:** Local `docker-compose` (v1.29) is incompatible with the project's v2-style compose file. Tests were orchestrated manually using `docker run` and `docker exec`.

## Next steps
1.  Commit and Push the dependency upgrades.
2.  Allow CI to validate the new Trixie-based image.
3.  Fix local `docker-compose` installation or update `scripts/smoke-test.sh` to be robust against older compose versions.
4.  If CI passes, tag `v0.6.0` (Major dependency shift) or `v0.5.2`.

## Session notes
- Verified Python 3.12.8 URL and existence.
- Verified Debian Trixie availability.
