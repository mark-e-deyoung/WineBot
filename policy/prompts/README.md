# Policy Prompts

This directory stores policy-related implementation prompts for coding agents.

- `implementation/`: active prompts used to implement or update policy-aligned functionality.
- `archive/`: retired or superseded prompts kept only for historical reference.

These prompt files are not runtime enforcement by themselves.
